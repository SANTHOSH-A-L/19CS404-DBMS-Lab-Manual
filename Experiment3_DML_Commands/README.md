# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
*Syntax (Single Row):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);

*Syntax (Multiple Rows):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);

*Syntax (Insert from another table):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;

### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;

### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
*Syntax (All rows):*
sql
DELETE FROM table_name;

*Syntax (Specific condition):*
sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
*Syntax:*
sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

*Question 1*
--
Write a SQL statement to change the first_name column of employees table with 'John' for those employees whose department_id is 80 and gets a commission_pct below 0.35.

Employees table

---------------
employee_id
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct
manager_id
department_id
For example:
```sql
update employees
set first_name = 'John'
where department_id = 80
and commission_pct<0.35;
```

*Output:*

*Question 2*
---
Write a SQL statement to Double the salary for employees in department 20 who have a job_id ending with 'MAN'

Employees table

---------------
employee_id
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct
manager_id
department_id

```sql
update employees
set salary= salary * 2
where department_id = 20
and job_id LIKE '%MAN';
```

*Output:*

*Question 3*
---
Write a SQL statement to increase the salary of employees under the department 40, 90 and 110 according to the company rules.

Salary will be increased by 25% for the department 40, 15% for department 90 and 10% for the department 110 and the rest of the departments will remain same.

Employees table

---------------
employee_id
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct
manager_id
department_id

```sql
update employees
set salary=
case
    when department_id=40 then salary *1.25
    when department_id=90 then salary *1.15
    when department_id=110 then salary *1.10
    else salary
end    
```

*Output:*

*Question 4*
---
Write a SQL statement to Update the per_unit_price to 25 and total_price accordingly in purchases table where purchase_date is '2022-08-15' and product_id is 12.

```sql
update purchases
set per_unit_price=25,
total_price=quantity*25
where purchase_date='2022-08-15'
and product_id = 12;
```

*Output:*

*Question 5*
---
Write a SQL statement to Increase the selling price by 10% for all products in the 'Bakery' category in the products table.

Products table

---------------
product_id
product_name
category
cost_price
sell_price

quantity
supplier_id
Answer:(penalty

```sql
update products
set sell_price=sell_price*1.10
where category='Bakery'
```
